# radar-inertial-odometry 
**The code for paper "Robust Radar-Inertial-Odometry in Dynamic 3D Environments" which is submitted to IROS 2023.**  
In this paper, we proposed a Radar-Inertial-Odometry (RIO) pipeline utilizing a long-range 4D millimeter-wave radar for autonomous vehicle navigation. 
The code and a test dataset are provided. A video of the demonstration of the method can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/Bk2WCr_wWeI).
